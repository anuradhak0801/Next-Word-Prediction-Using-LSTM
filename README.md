# Next-Word-Prediction-Using-LSTM
Typing assistants and predictive text tools have become essential in modern communication platforms, helping users type faster and more efficiently. Whether composing emails, messages, or search queries, intelligent next-word prediction enhances both speed and accuracy while reducing user effort.

This project focuses on building a deep learning model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict the next word in a sentence based on previous context. The model is trained on a large literary corpus and uses techniques like tokenization, sequence padding, n-gram generation, and word embeddings to learn meaningful language patterns. It employs categorical crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer, along with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

This project falls under the domains of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction. It has practical applications in Smart Keyboards, Virtual Assistants, Chatbots, Email Composition Tools, and Writing Enhancement Software.
